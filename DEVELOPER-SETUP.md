# MicroCODE App Template

A SaaS template built from the Gravity App Boilerplate.

This template was created from Kyle's GRAVITY-APP product in 2024, when MicroCODE `purchased` it and began modifications.
This template combines the best features from `gravity-current` and `ladders` to serve as a common base for building new MicroCODE SaaS applications.

This template will include all major features:

- **Multi-Lingual Support (i18n)**
- **Shadcn/UI Integration**
- **Express 5 Compatibility**
- **Enhanced Server Architecture** (SIG handling, graceful shutdown, port management)
- **JSDoc Annotations** for automatic API documentation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Support** for API documentation and testing
- **MicroCODE Packages** (mcode-\* packages)
- **MicroCODE Bootstrap System** for environment initialization
- **MongoDB \_id as Primary Key** (no secondary UUID)

NOTE: For testing multiple Clients against one Server, remove this from `VITE Config`:

```
  strictPort: true
```

## Description

MicroCODE purchased a complete license to the Gravity SaaS Boilerplate in
January 2024. We are free to use it to build as many Web Apps as we like, we
cannot resell the boilerplate nor any derivative of it.

This `app-template` serves as the foundation for building new MicroCODE SaaS applications, including:

- **LADDERS®** - PLC Programming Platform
- **Regatta RC™** - Remote Control Application
- Future MicroCODE SaaS products

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js 22+ - execution environment
- MongoDB - database
- Stripe - payments
- Mailgun - email service
- mcode-\* packages - MicroCODE logging, caching, data, and list processing
- ...

### Documentation

We selected Gravity as our SaaS Boilerplate because their code looked super-clean, consistent, and
they had beautiful online documentation, and training...

[Gravity Documentation](https://docs.usegravity.app/)

### Training

- MicroCODE purchased Gravity Training from Kyle, to access course: [Gravity Training Course](https://click.mlflow.com/link/c/YT0yMzg5NDM0OTg0Mzk5MTE1OTM3JmM9Zjd0NSZlPTQ2NzQ0NTIxJmI9OTczMTkwMTA1JmQ9cTFuNHoyeQ==.E8Etpdc01Kz2FeMURvW6oqmj9O6FqnopOVIiujHd1Z8)

### Initial Setup

1. Install MongoDB Community Edition

   - [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

2. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

   - [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

3. Install Node.js v22+

   - Using NVM: `nvm install 22.24.0` (or later)
   - Using NVM: `nvm use 22.24.0` (or later)

4. Clone the MicroCODE App Template repository

   - `git clone https://github.com/MicroCODE-App-Template/app-template.git`

5. Create a shared `.env` file

   - Clone `.env.example` to `.env.shared` in the root directory and fill in the required values
   - Note: `DB_CLIENT` controls '`npm run setup`' behavior in Steps 6 and 7
   - the `.env` files should never be committed to source control with real credentials!
   - the `.env` files are ignored by `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits, **_STORE them securely!_**
   - the `.env` files are required for both `server` and `mission-control` directories.
   - the `.env` files in `server` and `mission-control` must be identical.

6. Created a `.env` file in the `server` directory

   - Clone `.env.shared` to `.env` and fill in the required values

7. Created a `.env` file in the `mission-control` directory

   - Clone `.env.shared` to `.env` and fill in the required values

8. Setup proper DB Models and Install NPM dependencies
   - Move to the SERVER directory (`cd server`)
   - Run the setup script to create DB Models and install dependencies (`npm run setup`)
   - Move to the MISSION-CONTROL directory (`cd mission-control`)
   - Run the setup script to create DB Models and install dependencies (`npm run setup`)

#### MongoDB

MongoDB is our chosen DB for our SaaS.

To create a clean database for testing...

- Ensure you have admin privileges in the current MongoDB environment.
- To establish this from nothing...
- Install MongoDB and start with no security...
- Stop MongoDB - to erase current Dev environment

```
net stop mongodb
```

- UNINSTALL MongoDB from ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS...

- Delete existing MongoDB Data Files...

```
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\data\db"
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.2\data\db"
del *.*
```

- Delete existing MongoDB Log Files...

```
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\log"
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\6.0\log"
del *.*
```

- DOWNLOAD & INSTALL MongoDB from scratch.
- INSTALL MONGO DB SHELL...

```
winget install MongoDB.Shell
```

- Turn off default security...
  (Edit **mongod.cfg** and comment out these lines _if_ present)

```
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin"
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.2\bin"
edit mongod.cfg

#security:
#  authorization: "enabled"
```

- Start MongoDB -- if you just installed as a Windows Service it should have start automatically...

```
net start mongodb
```

- Shell into MongoDB (mongosh) and create your admin and application accounts...

```
mongosh

# First, confirm the existing admin/saas accounts (do not delete them)
use admin
db.getUsers()
# If the `admin` superuser is missing, create it with the command below, otherwise skip.
# db.createUser({ ... })

# Next, create the new application user in the `appDatabase`
use appDatabase
db.createUser({
  user: "appAdmin",
  pwd: "appPassword",
  roles: [
    { role: "readWrite", db: "appDatabase" },
    { role: "dbAdmin", db: "appDatabase" }
  ]
})

# Verify the users were created (admin + appDatabase coexist with existing saasDatabase)
use admin
db.getUsers()
use appDatabase
db.getUsers()
```

- Stop MongoDB

```
net stop mongodb
```

- Enable security... (Edit **mongod.cfg** enable these lines)
- NOTE: Remove `#` characters from both lines

```
security:
  authorization: "enabled"
```

- Restart MongoDB...

```
net start mongodb
```

- (Optional) Test the legacy `saasAdmin` connection if you still use it for other apps...

```
mongosh "mongodb://saasAdmin:saasPassword@localhost:27017/saasDatabase" --eval "db.getName()"
```

- Test the new `appAdmin` connection for this template...

```
mongosh "mongodb://appAdmin:appPassword@localhost:27017/appDatabase" --eval "db.getName()"
```

- Move to the SERVER directory (`cd server`)
- In the SERVER CLI, run the new MicroCODE scripts to create all static DB Tables

```
$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"
docker volume create mcode-app-name-mongodb-volume
npm run seed:all
```

- You should see these messages like these...
<p align="left"><img src=".\images\mongodb-run-seeds.png" width="720" title="Init new MongoDB" style="border: 0.5px solid lightgray;"></p>

- Then check the "saasDatabase" in mongosh for the default tables, similar to these...
<p align="left"><img src=".\images\mongodb-drop-database.png" width="720" title="Delete MongoDB" style="border: 0.5px solid lightgray;"></p>

# Production SECURITY

## What's Currently Set Up: ✅

- Authorization enabled
- User authentication required
- Role-based access control (saasAdmin has proper roles)
- Connection authentication working
- What You Should Consider Adding:

## Network Security

MongoDB is bound to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only) ✅ Good for development

- For production, keep it this way or use VPN/firewall rules

## Stronger Password

- Currently using saasPassword - change to a strong, random password for production

## Principle of Least Privilege ✅

- **Admin user (`admin`)**: Full access to all databases - use only for maintenance and user management
- **Application user (`appAdmin`)**: Limited to `appDatabase` only - used by the application
  - This isolation ensures leaked application credentials don't compromise other databases
- Consider creating additional users:
  - Read-only user for reporting
  - Backup user with minimal permissions

## Additional Security Measures (for production):

- Enable TLS/SSL encryption
- Enable audit logging
- Set up IP whitelisting
- Regular backups with encryption
- Rotate credentials periodically
- For your current development setup, you have everything you need. Just remember to:

Use a strong password before going to production
Never commit .env file with real credentials to git
Consider environment-specific users (dev vs production)

### Executing program

- Move to the SERVER directory (`cd server`)
- Start the development server (this also starts the Web Browser Client)

```
npm run dev
```

You should see `Server console` output like this...

<p align="left"><img src=".\images\npm-run-dev-1.png" width="720" title="Server startup" style="border: 0.5px solid lightgray;"></p>

The `Client` launches here, but is not 100% available until the Server completes...

<p align="left"><img src=".\images\npm-run-dev-2.png" width="720" title="Client startup" style="border: 0.5px solid lightgray;"></p>

And the `App` should automatically open to the Login screen, similar to this...

<p align="left"><img src=".\images\npm-run-dev-3.png" width="720" title="App Login" style="border: 0.5px solid lightgray;"></p>
