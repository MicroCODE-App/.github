# Admin Component Rules

## Architecture

The admin server (`/admin`)is a **NODE-based** administrative server:
This server follows a **layered architecture**:

- **API Layer** (`api/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Controller Layer** (`controller/`) - Business logic
- **Model Layer** (`model/`) - Database operations
- **Helper Layer** (`helper/`) - Reusable utilities

The admin console (`admin/console`) is a **React-based** administrative interface:
This client is a **React SPA** with:

- React Router for navigation
- Shadcn UI component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- i18next for internationalization

Together they provide:

- Backend control and maintenance
- User and account and DB Entity management
- System monitoring
- Administrative tools

## Core Principles

### Administrative Access

- Higher privilege levels than regular client
- Access to system-wide data (not just account-scoped)
- Administrative actions require careful validation

### Security

- **ALWAYS** validate admin permissions server-side
- **NEVER** trust client-side permission checks
- Log all administrative actions
- Implement audit trails

## File Structure

- Follow React patterns similar to client
- Admin-specific components and views
- Administrative API endpoints

## Code Style

- Follow same React patterns as client
- Use Shadcn UI components when available
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clear separation between admin and user-facing code

## Best Practices

- Implement proper access controls
- Audit all administrative actions
- Provide clear admin UI/UX
- Follow existing admin patterns
