# .github

Our core Web App framework, used for all our web apps, built from licensed Gravity Zero, Ltd. template.

This GitHub Organization has (5) repositories that form a complete App Solution:

- `admin` — Admin console/backend
- `app` — Mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android)
- `client` — Web client
- `porta` — Portal/marketing site (Astro)
- `server` — Backend API server

This is a multi-repo setup where each component is versioned independently but works together.

Common benefits:

- Independent versioning and releases
- Separate access controls
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to scale teams per component
