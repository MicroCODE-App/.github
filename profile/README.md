## Architecture Overview

### Layered API Structure

**UI Layer** - Server-Side Rendering

- System operations and commands
- View and component rendering
- Modal components via HTMX
- Banner notifications
- Enum resolution and lookups

**UX Layer** - Client-Side Interactivity

- Media rendering (local/remote)

- Interactive components

**DB Layer** - Data Persistence

- Entity CRUD operations
- Schema management
- Query optimization
- Multi-database support

**IO Layer** - External Integration

- Real-time data streaming
- Hardware interfacing
- Health monitoring
- External API integration

## Entity Configuration System

The `__config.js` file serves as the single source of truth:

```javascript
{
    name: 'entity',
    description: 'Entity description for documentation',
    api: ['ui', 'db'],           // Exposed APIs
    nature: 'logical',            // Entity type
    resolves: true,               // UUID resolution
    auth: {
        create: 'Engineer',
        read: 'Operator',
        update: 'Engineer',
        delete: 'Admin',
    }
}
```

This automatically generates:

- Database tables and enums
- API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Swagger documentation
- UI views and forms
- Authorization middleware
