## Overview

MicroCODE App Template serves as the foundation for all MicroCODE, Inc. SaaS products. It provides a battle-tested, feature-rich platform that eliminates boilerplate development and accelerates time-to-market for new applications.

This is our **active development platform** - the customized derivative of the licensed Gravity boilerplate that we use to build production applications.

This GitHub Organization has (5) repositories that form a complete App Solution:

- `admin` — Admin console/backend [Gravity's "mission-control"]
- `app` — Mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android) [Gravity's "client-react-native"]
- `client` — Web client [Gravity's "client-react-web"]
- `portal` — Portal/marketing site (Astro) [Gravity's "supernova"]
- `server` — Backend API server [Gravity's "server"]

This is a multi-repo setup where each component is versioned independently but works together.

Common benefits:

- Independent versioning and releases
- Separate access controls
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to scale teams per component

📋 **[Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history and release notes

### Version Management

- Platform version follows semantic versioning (vM.F.p), see **[App Versioning GIT Rules](../DOCs/DEV/DEVELOPER-GIT.md)**
- Breaking changes communicated to all product teams
- Backward compatibility maintained whereever possible
- Migration guides provided for major updates
