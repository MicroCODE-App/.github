# App Versions & MicroCODE Git Workflow

This guide mirrors the [MicroCODE Software Support Process](./DEVELOPER-SSP.md) (SSP) and documents how developers work with Git branches, semantic versioning, and the four GitFlow templates stored under `./.github/GIT - Issue Notes/`.

**`vM.F.H`**

- `M` = Major Release (architecture/design/API change)
- `F` = Feature Release (bundle of enhancements delivered together)
- `H` = Hotfix Patch (single production fix)

Tags use `vM.F.H` on `main`. Branch names never embed the version except for the long-lived `release/bM.F.0` branch.

## 1. Branch Types & When to Use Them

**Key principle:** Releases are completely decoupled from `develop`.
You select specific, tested features from their individual branches and combine them on a safe foundation (`main`).

This keeps Production stable, Beta Release branches focused and testable, and `develop` free to accumulate features without blocking releases.

```
main                (Production)
  ├── hotfix/*      (Emergency patches in main)
  ├── develop       (Alpha - Integration branch)
  ├── feature/*     (New features from main, accumulate in develop)
  │   └── bugfix/*  (Defect corrections in alpha test)
  └── release/*     (Beta - Forked from main, cherry-picks selected features)
      └── bugfix/*  (Defect corrections in beta test)
```

| Branch                           | Purpose                                                | Source                                                                                  | Merge Target(s)                              | Documenation Template                                                       |

| `develop`                        | Alpha integration branch where features accumulate.    | `main`                                                                                  | None: integration and testing branch         | --                                                                          |

| `feature/{issue#}--{short-name}` | Implements a single GitHub Issue (new capability).     | `main`                                                                                  | `develop` and cherry-picked into `release/*` | [feature](../../ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature/feature-nnnn--feature-short-name.md) |
| `bugfix/{issue#}--{short-name}`  | Fixes discovered while in Alpha or Beta testing.       | `feature/*` (canonical source) or `release/bM.F.0` (if feature branch no longer exists) | `feature/*`, `develop`, or `release/*`       | [bugfix](../../ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bugfix/bugfix-nnnn--bugfix-short-name.md)     |

Notes:

- For Beta bugfixes, we create from the affected `feature/*` branch (canonical source) to ensure fixes persist even if the `release/*` branch is abandoned.

Naming rules:

- `nnnn` = the GitHub Issue number zero-padded to four digits.
- Use double dashes between the issue number and the short snake-case summary, e.g. `feature/0045--add-sidebar-builder`.
- Only `release/bM.F.0` branch includes version numbers; all other branches reference Issues.
- The `develop` branch will be tagged with alpha semantic version for testers, `aM.F.H`
- When a `release` branch is promoted to `main` its Hotfix Patch number is reset to `0`.

## 2. Version Bumping Rules & Commands

### Major Release → `v(M+1).0.0`

The only difference between a MAJOR Release and a FEATURE Release is the nature of the Features being included.
Use when architecture, APIs, or significant design shifts occur, this is a MAJOR Release.

MAJOR Release test questions:

1. Does the Features set break existing Customer extensions or API usage? Yes = MAJOR
2. Does the Feature set force a change in Customer connected services or suppliers (Stripe, Mailgun, etc.)? Yes = MAJOR

### Feature Release → `vM.(F+1).0`

**Critical:** Release branches are forked from `main` (proven safe code) and we cherry-pick **directly from `feature/*` branches**, NOT from `develop`. This completely decouples releases from `develop`, preventing "release paralysis" and giving you full control over what ships.

**Why NOT cherry-pick from `develop`?**

- `develop` may have incomplete features, experimental code, or integration issues
- Cherry-picking from `develop` still ties you to its unstable state
- You want to select specific, tested features—not whatever happens to be in `develop`

**Planning a Release:**

1. Review completed `feature/*` branches (regardless of `develop` state)
2. Select which features are most needed by customers
3. Fork `release/bM.F.0` from `main` (safe starting point)
4. Cherry-pick **directly from the `feature/*` branch commits**
5. Test a focused, manageable integration of `main` + `features`

```bash
# Develop the major feature
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/0100--new-render-core
git checkout -b feature/0144--new-json-templates
git checkout -b feature/0151--new-api-v2
# develop, test, document with FEATURE template

# implement feature(s) and merge into develop for alpha testing
git checkout develop
git merge feature/0100--new-render-core
git merge feature/0144--new-json-templates
git merge feature/0151--new-api-v2
git tag a2.0.0

# Fork a new release from main (safe), cherry-pick directly from feature branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/b2.0.0
git cherry-pick feature/0100--new-render-core
git cherry-pick feature/0144--new-json-templates
# 🚫 intentionally skip feature/0151--new-api-v2 (it stays in develop until it’s ready)
git tag b2.0.0

# run SAT/UAT, when 100%..
git checkout main
git merge release/b2.0.0
git tag v2.0.0
```

### Hotfix (Production) → `vM.F.(H+1)`

Used when production needs an immediate correction. The hotfix increments the `H` component of SemVer.

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/0067--connection-retry

# fix, test, document with HOTFIX template
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/0067--connection-retry

# increment H
git tag v2.1.(H+1)

# echo into develop branch to keep it current
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/0067--connection-retry

# increment H, may *not* be the same as main vM.F.(H)
git tag a2.1.(H+1)

# echo into any open release branch as well
git checkout release/b2.2.0
git merge hotfix/0067--connection-retry

# increment H, may *not* be the same as main vM.F.(H), or alpha aM.F.(H)
# NOTE: This does *not* change the name of the release/* branch.
git tag b2.2.(H+1)
```

### Bugfix (Beta) → made to canonical source (feature/\*)

Use when a defect is found while the Beta Release Candidate (RC) is in SAT/UAT.
The bugfix is made to the original feature/\* branch, then echoed into release/\*, and develop.
The result is tagged `bM.F.(H+1)` in the release/\* branch, the branch name is unchanged.

```bash
git checkout feature/0100--new-render-core
git checkout -b bugfix/0067--connection-retry

# fix, test, document with BUGFIX template
git checkout feature/0100--new-render-core
git merge bugfix/0067--connection-retry

# echo into develop branch to keep it current
git checkout develop
git merge bugfix/0067--connection-retry

# increment H, may *not* be the same as main vM.F.(H)
git tag a2.1.(H+1)

# echo into any open release branch as well
git checkout release/b2.2.0
git merge bugfix/0067--connection-retry

# increment H, may *not* be the same as main vM.F.(H), or alpha aM.F.(H)
git tag b2.2.(H+1)
```

## 3. Branch Naming Quick Reference

Patterns:

```
main
hotfix/{issue#}--{short-snake-name}
develop
feature/{issue#}--{short-snake-name}
bugfix/{issue#}--{short-snake-name}
release/bM.F.0
```

Examples:

```
main
hotfix/0067--connection-retry
develop
feature/0045--add-sidebar-builder
bugfix/0080--toast-null-check
release/b2.2.0
```

## 4. Practical Checklist

- **PR Titles:** `[vM.F.H] Description` (e.g.: `[v2.2.0] Add sidebar builder`)
- **Issue Linking (Non-Closing):** Reference Issues with **non-closing** phrases such as `Refs #NNNN`, `Related to #NNNN`, or `Implements part of #NNNN` so GitHub **does not** auto-close Issues when a single PR is merged.
- **Branch Protection:** `main`, `develop`, and active `release/*` require PR approval + status checks.
- **Tags:** Always tag releases on `main`. Hotfix tags use the next `H` value.
- **Documentation:** Use the Markdown templates in `./.github/GIT - Issue Notes/` to capture context before merging.
- **Auto-delete:** Enable automatic branch deletion in GitHub settings for merged branches.

### Issue & Branch Lifecycle Rules

To align Git behavior with the Circles model, keep branches and Issues open until changes have propagated through all required environments. Use the following lifecycle rules:

- **`hotfix/{issue#}--{short-name}`**

  - Create from `main` for emergency production fixes.
  - Reference the Issue using non-closing phrases only (`Refs #NNNN`, etc.).
  - Merge the hotfix into `main`, then **echo** the same branch into `develop` and any open `release/*` branches.
  - Keep both the `hotfix/*` branch and the Issue **open** until all required merges are complete and verified.
  - Close the Issue and delete the branch **manually** once the fix is confirmed in Production.

- **`feature/{issue#}--{short-name}`**

  - Implements a single GitHub Issue.
  - Merge into `develop` for Alpha integration, and cherry-pick into the appropriate `release/bM.F.0` branch(es) as needed.
  - Keep the feature branch and Issue **open** until the selected `release/*` has been merged into `main` and the capability is live.
  - Close the Issue and delete the branch **manually** after Production verification.

- **`bugfix/{issue#}--{short-name}`**
  - Create from the canonical `feature/*` branch (or `release/*` if the feature branch no longer exists).
  - Merge back into the canonical branch, then echo into `develop` and any affected `release/*` branches.
  - Keep the bugfix branch and Issue **open** until the corrected code has flowed through `release/*` into `main`.
  - Close the Issue and delete the branch **manually** once the fix is verified in Production.

In all cases, avoid closing Issues automatically via `Fixes #NNNN`/`Closes #NNNN` so that Issue state reflects the true end-to-end lifecycle across Alpha, Beta, and Production.

## 5. Template Index

- Feature work: [feature template](./ISSUEs/feature/feature-nnnn--feature-short-name.md)
- Bugfix during Beta: [bugfix template](./ISSUEs/bugfix/bugfix-nnnn--bugfix-short-name.md)
- Hotfix to Production: [hotfix template](./ISSUEs/hotfix/hotfix-nnnn--hotfix-short-name.md)
- Release coordination: [release template](./ISSUEs/release/release-bM.F.0.md)

Each template aligns with the MicroCODE Software Support Process (SSP) expectations
([Problem → Observation → Resolution → Verification]()) and should be completed before requesting a PR review.

## 6. Branch Naming Conventions (GitHub Organizations with Multiple Repos)

Most Web Apps are deployed within GitHub Organizations.
When working within an Organization, create branches and PRs according to the following checklist:

- [ ] `.github` - type/nnnn-gx-type-short-name
- [ ] `server` - type/nnnn--db-type-short-name
- [ ] `client` - type/nnnn--ui-type-short-name
- [ ] `app` - type/nnnn--ux-type-short-name
- [ ] `admin` - type/nnnn--ad-type-short-name
- [ ] `console` - type/nnnn--cs-type-short-name
- [ ] `portal` - type/nnnn--wp-type-short-name

  - where **type** is: `hotfix`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `security`, or `release`.

- See [DEVELOPER-SSP.md](./DEVELOPER-SSP.md) for more information.
