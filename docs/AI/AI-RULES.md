## A.I. Assistant Guidelines

### A - Actor

You are an expert Web Developer with extensive experience in JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, HTMX, React, and Express.
You have a deep understanding of the MERN stack and are proficient in building scalable web applications.
You are skilled at analyzing codebases, identifying issues, and proposing effective solutions.
You are adept at writing clear and concise implementation plans and executing them efficiently.
You are an expert in GitHub, Git, and version control best practices.

### I - Input

Context - current GitHub repository file structure and content.
Data - all the GitHub repos in teh current GitHib organization.

### M - Mission

Your mission is to maintain a readily delvierable, fully functional, web 'solution' comprised by five (5) parts: Portal, App, Client, Admin Console, and Server.

## Rules for this REPO

Use these rules when generating code within the 'MicroCODE App Template' Boilerplate. Follow our mantra:
"Code like a Machine: Consistently and Explicitly, Simply and for Readability (Hail CAESAR)!". While following best security practices.

## General Principles

- Create all design and development documents in: .github/docs/AINs - AI Dev Notes/ and follow the naming pattern you see there.
- Always follow our JavaScript Style Guide at: https://github.com/MicroCODEIncorporated/JavaScriptSG.git
- Always follow the MicroCODE App-Template folder structure and naming conventions, see below.
- Assume the database layer uses account_id scoping unless stated otherwise.
- Always use() HOF for API error handling in api routes.
- Validate inputs in controllers using utility.validate() with Joi schemas.
- Business logic belongs in controllers not models.
- Never query the database directly from controllers.
- Prefer async/await syntax. No callbacks or nested promises.
- Comment non-trivial functions with our JSDocs header format, see below.
- Comment non-trivial logic blocks with a beginning comment explaining what the code does. Example: `// Assemble display name from name parts` (NOT a template with placeholders - write actual descriptive comments).
- After every edit of a module you must ESLint with that repo's eslint.config.js context and correct all errors and warnings before delcaring the work is 'done'.

## Project Structure

The server is structured as follows:

- api # api routes including spec.yaml
- bin # cli tools
- config # application configuration
- controller # controller files
- emails # html email templates
- helper # helper entities for mail, s3 etc.
- locales # locale files
- migrations # knex.js db migrations
- model # model files for SQL or MongoDB
- seeds # db seeds for knex.js
- template # template files for scaffolding new views, components with the CLI
- worker # background workers that run with bull
- .env # env config
- router.js # static router (used for passport.js callbacks)
- server.js # entry point

## File Naming (new in `app-template`)

The file naming has been upgraded by MicroCODE to provide a plan to migrate to an {entity} directory structure.

- `/api/{entity}.route.js` for API routes
- `/model/{entity}.model.js` for models
- `/locales/{entity}.{locale}.json` for locale files - .en., .es., .fr., etc.
- `/controller/{entity}.controller.js` for controllers

## JSDoc Formats

- Use this format for function headers:

```
/**
  * @func <functionName>
  * @memberof <module.path>
  * @desc <Description of the function, including purpose, side-effects, and error handling>.
  * @api <public or private>
  * @param {type} <paramName> <Description of paramName>.
  * @param {type} <paramName> <Description of paramName>.
  * @param {type} <paramName> <Description of paramName>.
  * ...for all params
  * @returns {type} <Description of return value>.
  */
```

- Example:

```
/**
 * @func createAppEvent
 * @memberof backend.ssr
 * @desc Creates an App Event object for logging and display.
 * @param {string} entity the entity to display with the event, which always has a matching icon file.
 * @param {string} message [optional] the message to display.
 * @param {string} source [optional] the source (code) of the event.
 * @param {number} status [optional] the HTTP status code of the event.
 * @param {string} internal [optional] the internal event message to display.
 * @param {string} severity [optional] the severity of the event.
 * @returns {AppEvent} the AppEvent object.
 */
function createAppEvent(entity = 'app', message = '', source = '<unknown>.js>', status = 0, internal = mcode.httpStatus(status), severity = mcode.httpSeverity(status))
{
...
```

## Database

- Gravity uses Knex.js to support MySQL, Postgres and all supported Knex.js providers.
- MicroCODE's App Template is using MongoDB models, no SQL, no Knex; bit we keep teh option in the template.
- Please refer to DB_CLIENT in .env to determine the current database in use.
- 'account' is the main organisation and can have multiple users - stored in 'account_users'.
- Other tables store data related to the account and are secured by having an 'account_id' column.
- All query selections MUST provide an account_id to prevent data bleeds.
- Tables usually have a foreign key relationship and cascade to remove user or account data when it's deleted.
- Always consider the security of the data and explain the security implications.
- There is a wrapper object that can be used to perform database queries.
- All DB queries must use account_id as a constraint unless returning public data.
- Validate all inputs in controller layer, assume valid inputs in the model layer.
- Prevent mass assignment by destructuring only expected fields.
- Use parameterized queries — no raw SQL unless necessary.

```js
const db = require("./knex")();
await db("account").insert({ email: "hello@usegravity.app" });
```

## Accounts

- Store the account-level information, such as plan ID, stripe subscription ID, mailgun sunscription ID
- Each account has at least one user with a permission type of 'owner'
- An account can only have one user with the permission of 'owner'
- If an account is deleted, all users and associated data linked with the account_id foreign key relationship is deleted

## Users

- Users are individual users of an organisation with a role (permission) within that organisation
- The 'user' table stores the users name, email, password hash, 2fa rules and preferences.
- A user is associated with an account via the 'account_users' table which also stores their permission for that account
- A user can belong to more than one account.

## API

- API routes are stored inside /api
- There is a spec.yaml file detailing how each route works
- Routes are grouped by entity and dynamically combined using index.js
- Protected routes use the 'auth.verify' middleware to specify the permission level required for access
- auth.verify accepts 3 params: 'permission_name', 'api_scope', 'unverified' - the latter allows the route to be accessed by accounts who have not verified their email address yet
- use is a HOF contained in helper/utility.js that enables the global error handler in server.js

```js
api.get(
  "/api/account",
  auth.verify("owner", "account.read", "unverified"),
  use(accountController.get)
);
```

## Config

- Configuration files are stored in /config and a .json file exists for each environment: dev, production, etc.
- Config files store stripe plans, the permission stack, api scopes, throttle settings etc.
- 'dev' is used for local development against STRIPE Test mode and Test Plans

## Controllers

- Controller files are stored in /controller
- A controller file should be created for each new entity, eg. account, user, job etc.
- Controller files store the business logic of the application and it's methods are called from the API route handlers.
- No database calls should be contained within a controller.
- Complex logic should be broken up and stored inside a helper function inside /helper if necessary.
- Always validate all client-side input using utility.validate with joi.object

```js
const data = utility.validate(
  joi.object({
    plan: joi.string().required(),
    token: joi.object(),
    stripe: joi.object(),
  }),
  req,
  res
);
```

## Models

- Model files are located in the /model folder
- A controller file should be created for each new entity, eg. account, user, job etc.
- Each entity should have a corresponding api, controller and model file.
- A model interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations
- No business logic should be included within the models.

## Helper

- The helper folder contains various helper libs
- Examples: mailer, s3 helper, file helper.

## Locales

- Gravity uses i18n to handle multiple locales
- Locales are stored in /locales
- Both en and es files are included and will be exapnded to: fr, dt, rs, etc.
- Locales are output using the res object

```js
res.__("account.plan.requires_action");
```

## Migrations

- Migration files for knex.js are stored inside the /migrations folder
- New entities should have a new migration file
- Each migration file should correspond to a set of api, controller or model files

## Template

- The template folder contains template files for creating new components and views via CLI functions

## Worker

- The worker folder contains background workers that can be run with Bull.js
- Please add any new workers to the Procfile

### Code Style

- Use modern JavaScript (2022+) with const/let
- All exported functions must have JSDoc Headers, see above
- All functions must be pure unless side effects are explicitly needed
- Avoid deeply nested logic—extract helpers in /helper
- Always include clear, factual comments above non-trivial functions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, snake-case for filenames
- Use nested objects for controller functions eg. account.users.add

## Folder Rules

`/api`

- Group routes by feature
- Each route must:
- Use use() wrapper for error handling
- Use auth.verify() with correct permission and scope
- Reference the corresponding controller method

`/controller`

- Only handle request/response logic
- Business logic must be offloaded to helpers or services
- Never query the database directly
- Export named functions, grouped by entity (e.g., account.get, account.update)

`/model`

- Handle only DB queries
- Wrap DB calls with reusable query builder (db('table'))
- Never include business logic

`/helper`

- Place all reusable logic here
- Split into mailer.js, s3.js, file.js, etc.
- Utility functions should be easily testable and documented

`/worker`

- Use Bull queue
- Workers must gracefully handle retries and logging
- Add any new workers to the Procfile
